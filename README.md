# Ultimate
A simplified theme for Stepmania 5.0.12 and 5.1.x, updated for OutFox play.

## Why update this?

It was mostly curiosity. I was around at the time when 5.1-3 happened, and caused so much confusion around people as typical workflows for themes were seemengly replaced overnight, and had to try to figure out how to work with it. Only about 3 themes (I could be wrong) were made for that version, ultimate, while not starting as a 5.1-3 theme, would later be updated to only support that version.

So, this repo provides an updated version that works with OutFox builds, a42 at a minimum, while retaining most of the original code.

## Would additions be made?

Possibly? It definitely won't be high priority, given that I'm working on OutFox, but there are a few features that were left unfinished in the theme that I could take a look into later, such as: mouse inputs and score viewing.

# Original theme description

This theme was started back in 2013, aiming to streamline stepmania game flow by removing unnecessary clutter, options and exaggerated animations, and making it smooth and straightforward for the player no matter what gamemode they are in, be it dance, pump, or whatever. After picking it up again, hopefully the new things I learned in the meantime can be applied into this theme to make a good experience for whoever uses it.
