A simplified theme for Stepmania 5.0.12 and 5.1.x

This theme was started back in 2013, aiming to streamline stepmania game flow by removing unnecessary clutter, options and exaggerated animations, and making it smooth and straightforward for the player no matter what gamemode they are in, be it dance, pump, or whatever. After picking it up again, hopefully the new things I learned in the meantime can be applied into this theme to make a good experience for whoever uses it.
